              Traditional Kazakh Cuisine
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Kazakh cuisine reflects the country's nomadic heritage and harsh
              climate. Traditionally, Kazakh food centered around meat and dairy
              products, with horse meat and mutton being particularly important.
              The nomadic lifestyle required food that was easy to prepare and
              provided substantial energy for life on the steppes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Today, while maintaining its traditional roots, Kazakh cuisine has
              also incorporated influences from Russian, Uzbek, Uyghur, and
              other Central Asian culinary traditions. Here we present some of
              the most beloved and distinctive Kazakh delicacies that every
              visitor should try.

                    The national dish of Kazakhstan, Beshbarmak (meaning "five
                    fingers" as it's traditionally eaten with the hands)
                    consists of boiled horse meat or mutton served over large,
                    flat noodles and topped with a flavorful onion sauce. The
                    meat is typically boiled for several hours to create a rich
                    broth, which is served alongside the dish in small bowls
                    called "sorpa."

                    Kazy is a traditional Kazakh sausage made from horse meat,
                    specifically from the rib area. The meat is seasoned with
                    garlic, pepper, and other spices, then stuffed into the
                    horse's intestine and either boiled or smoked. Kazy is often
                    served sliced as an appetizer or as part of the main
                    Beshbarmak dish.

                    While originally from Uzbekistan, Plov has become a staple
                    in Kazakh cuisine. This hearty rice dish is made with meat
                    (usually lamb), carrots, onions, and various spices. The
                    Kazakh version often includes more meat and fewer vegetables
                    than its Uzbek counterpart. Plov is typically prepared in a
                    large cast-iron pot called a "kazan."

                    Kuurdak is a traditional dish made from fried meat (usually
                    lamb or beef) with potatoes and onions. The meat is cut into
                    small pieces and fried until crispy, then combined with the
                    vegetables and spices. This hearty dish was popular among
                    nomads due to its simplicity and the ability to prepare it
                    quickly over an open fire.

                    Baursak are small pieces of fried dough, similar to donuts
                    but usually unsweetened. These puffy, golden bread pieces
                    are a staple at Kazakh celebrations and are typically served
                    with tea. They can be eaten with honey or jam for a sweet
                    treat, or alongside savory dishes.

                    Shelpek is a traditional flatbread that holds cultural
                    significance in Kazakh cuisine. It's often prepared for
                    special occasions and religious ceremonies. The dough is
                    rolled thin and fried in oil, resulting in a crispy exterior
                    and soft interior. Shelpek is typically round and can be
                    either sweet or savory.

                    Samsa are baked pastries filled with meat (usually lamb),
                    onions, and spices. Similar to samosas found in other
                    cultures, Kazakh samsa are typically triangular or square in
                    shape and baked in a tandoor oven, giving them a distinctive
                    flavor and crispy texture. They make for a perfect portable
                    snack or appetizer.

                    These small, hard balls or chunks have a salty, sour taste
                    and were historically important for nomadic Kazakhs as they
                    could be preserved for long periods. Kurt is still popular
                    today as a snack and is often enjoyed with beer or added to
                    soups for flavor.

                    Kumys is fermented mare's milk and has been a staple of
                    nomadic Kazakh culture for centuries. Slightly alcoholic
                    (about 2%) with a tangy, sour taste, it's considered to have
                    health benefits and is especially popular during summer
                    months. Traditionally, it was prepared in leather bags that
                    were periodically beaten to ensure proper fermentation.

                    fermented dairy drink with a distinctive taste. It's thicker
                    than kumys and has a slightly higher fat content. Shubat is
                    particularly common in the western and southern regions of
                    Kazakhstan where camels are more prevalent.

                    making it more accessible to those unaccustomed to fermented
